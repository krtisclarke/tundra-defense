     menu. It goes through startGame rather than resetting the live Game: the

     starts with, so a fresh Game cannot drift out of date the way a hand-written
     reset would every time a field is added. (Second Chance is the opposite
     operation — it deliberately KEEPS the board — so there is nothing to share.)

     Three things have to happen around it, none of which startGame does:
       · bank the XP first. Kills are only banked at the end of a wave, so
         everything felled since then is unbanked, and the colony rank that
         recruits new penguins is built from exactly those kills. The game's
         standing rule is that a sea lion felled is never forfeited, defeat
         included, and a restart should not be the one exception.
       · delete the save. It is keyed on the level alone and startGame does not
         touch it, so the abandoned run would still be sitting there offering
         "Continue — wave 23" from the level card.
       · drop the wake lock before taking a new one. keepAwake(true) overwrites
         the sentinel without releasing it, which is fine today only because
         every other route into startGame comes from the menu with no lock held.

     battlefield.

     It used to open down the left of the map, which meant that reading a
     penguin's upgrades cost you 178px of the thing you were reading them about
     — a quarter of the battlefield on a phone — and put the card in the one
     place an iPhone's Dynamic Island also wants. Here it covers nothing: the
     tray and the hero and boost panels step aside for it and step back when it
     closes, and the battlefield is never touched.

     It takes the WHOLE column — the build tray, the hero chip, the boosts and
     the wave controls — and not just the tray's row.

     The first version took the tray alone and left the rest showing. That was
     the wrong trade twice over. It gave the card 238px on a phone to hold
     contents that need about 270, so the rows had to be squeezed and what an
     upgrade DOES could not be shown at all: three lines a row simply did not
     exist, and a player who cannot read an upgrade cannot plan one. And it made
     the card an odd half-panel sitting in a column that was otherwise still the
     dock. The full column is 382px on the same phone. The extra 144 is what
     pays for the descriptions, with room left over.

     What it costs is the boosts and the wave controls while a card is open, and
     the way out is the way in: the X, a tap on the battlefield, or Escape. The
     hazard to keep an eye on is muscle memory — Send Wave lives where the sell
     button now lands — which is why selling still asks first.

     Measured off the panels rather than computed from the same numbers fitCanvas
     used, because their boxes are the product of a grid, a container query and a
     margin, and a second opinion here could only disagree with the first.
     offsetTop/offsetHeight, not getBoundingClientRect: #sidebar carries a scale
     transform and a rect includes it, which had the card re-measuring itself
     small every time it re-rendered. The offset box is the untransformed one.

     A column that measures near nothing is a layout that has not settled —
     mid-rotation, entering fullscreen, an installed app being restored — and
     writing that rect would pin the card to a sliver. Left alone instead, and
     the card keeps whatever box it had. */

         path you had already bought into looked exactly like one you had not,
         because the only thing separating them was which of three 5px dots
         were tinted. So after your first upgrade the card stopped answering
         the two questions it exists to answer: how far along am I, and can I
         still go further.

         One skeleton now. Line one is the path name and how many of its three
         tiers you own, as a number in a chip — with the padlock or the star in
         the chip too, because line two is only about 105px wide once the ⓘ and
         the price have had their share, and a leading glyph there took enough
         off it to clip "Rolling Thunder" to "Rolling Thun…". Line two is
         always a label and an optional value: what you would buy next and what
         it costs, or why you cannot buy anything. And a path you have fish in
         wears a green edge — gold once it is finished — so which two you
         committed to reads at a glance without counting anything.

         Three lines now, not two. The card moved into the control column,
         which is about 30px narrower than the width the rows were tuned to —
         and what pays for that is the ⓘ button, which took 41px out of every
         row and is gone. Losing it leaves the name MORE room than it had, and
         the description it used to hide comes back into the row itself, which
