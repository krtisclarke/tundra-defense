/* Network first, cache as the fallback — not the other way round.

   Cache-first is the usual advice and it was wrong here. It answers from the
   copy on disk and only refreshes in the background, so the first visit after
   an update always shows the PREVIOUS version, and a second visit is needed to
   see the new one. Playing on a phone that is a nuisance; while the game is
   being worked on it reads as the change having been lost, and cost a round of
   "it reverted" over a build that had shipped correctly.

   The trade is one network round-trip when online, on a handful of small files
   from the same origin. With no network — the whole point of the cache — the
   fetch fails and the stored copy answers exactly as before, so the
   home-screen app still works offline. */
